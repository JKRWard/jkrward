      <h1> Conference musings </h1>

      <p> 
      In May I was lucky enough to attend the Internationl Conference of Statistical Ecology which was being held up the road in St. Andrews. It was my first time at this particular conference and I was apprehensive. Thankfully I was able to attend whilst not actually presenting any of my work (the prospect of showing my work to real statisticians is still terrifying!) meaning that I could just enjoy being there and soaking up all of the information that was on offer. Before  I went I was worried that I wouldn't understand anything, as is fairly typical for me I tend to assume that I'm going to be the least intelligent person in the room. Whilst that may have been the case I actually found that I did know somethings and during the week I learned a whole load more. 
         </p>
        
      <p> 
      At first I got a bit lost in a sea of equations and I was worried I was in the wrong place, and then a friend reminded me that lots of the people presenting were trained statisticians and not necessairily ecologists. I tend to approach my work from a more ecological perspective (naturally) and I think less about the maths, I'll code a function so that it works for my model and then I'll think about how on earth that can be mathematically presented.  By the middle of the week I found that equations were being shown on the screen and when I listened to the explanation I realised that what I was seeing was just the maths behind much of the coding that I have been doing.
